            "0.83: 1. Introduction All languages make use of variations in the musical pitch of the voice as part of their sound systems, but they differ in the ways in which modifications of pitch are used and how many different types of functions are served by pitch variations. Linguists distinguish between two of the major uses of pitch as tone and intonation . Intonation is the term that is used to describe sentence types, such as question versus statement, or to indicate whether a speaker has finished or intends to continue speaking, or to show which parts of an utterance present new or highlighted information versus old or less significant information. Tone is the term used to describe the use of pitch patterns to distinguish individual words or the grammatical forms of words, such as the singular and plural forms of nouns or different tenses of verbs. In the simplest cases, each syllable of a language with tones will have its own characteristic tonal pattern, which may be a relatively flat pitch at a particular level, or may involve the pitch rising or falling over the duration of the syllable. When the pitch has a moving pattern of this sort, the tone is described as a contour tone . Many of the languages of East and Southeast Asia, including all varieties of Chinese as well as Vietnamese and Thai , have tone systems that include contour tones. In Thai , for example, full syllables have one of five tones, of which three are basically flat at high, mid and low pitch levels, and the remaining two are rising and falling in shape. The syllable shape /kʰaa/ thus corresponds to five different words depending on the tone — /kʰáá/ with high tone means ‘to trade’, /kʰāā/ with mid tone means ‘to get stuck’, /kʰàà/ with low tone means ‘galangal’, /kʰàá/ with rising tone means ‘leg’\n",
